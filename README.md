Every F***ing Failure
- 💞️ Hi, I’m @fleecey, a sheep girl and fucking failure.
- To prove this I am uploading every embarrassing project I've ever attempted. I've convinced myself that if I am transparent and face my limitations head on then I will get over
my fear of failure or learn or grow or maybe even realize that I'm not actually that bad. Consider this a form of therapy.
